## About Me

I am a **Data Analyst** with a Master's in Finance, specializing in Business and Data Analytics from **Nova School of Business and Economics**. With a strong foundation in data analysis, I leverage tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau to transform complex datasets into clear, actionable insights. I am driven by the power of data storytellingâ€”identifying patterns, visualizing trends, and turning raw information into impactful solutions that empower data-driven decision-making. My passion lies in creating meaningful narratives that not only inform but also inspire strategic choices and organizational success.
